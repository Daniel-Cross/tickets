# Nutickets Tech Test

Tech test for Nutickets based on documentation received from recruiter:

>Front End Coding Challenge
>Create a static HTML page, using HTML5, Javascript, jQuery and CSS, using the attached PSD file. The photoshop is a draft, your copy doesn’t need to be pixel perfect, but try to pay attention to detail as much as possible. The [USE AS IMAGE] layer group contains areas where it’s enough to use images instead of using proper solutions (like icon fonts, or charts).

>In the header when you click the Open dialog button, that should open the design found in the Dialog layer group. 

>The Sales popup tip layer group should appear if the user clicks on the information button above.

>The Reports - Sales / Reports - Tickets layer groups should work as a slider when Sales or Tickets are clicked in the block’s submenu.

## Built using:

+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript
+ Skeleton UI

## Notes

Unfortunately, due to time restraints I have been unable to complete the whole test listed above. I also found it to be quite vague and therefore wasn't entilery sure what the desired outcome for the Sale's popup or Tickets layer groups/slider was referring to. I would be more than happy to complete another task if necessary.

* This website is optomised for screen resolution size 1920 x 1080.

## To be completed

+ If given more time I would work on making this readable on different media platforms other than the one mentioned.
